                                            The fastest intervention-free hot reconfiguration employs switching between two prepared Staged Control Sets.    10                                                                                   Note: Support for the 2nd Staged Control Set is advertised independently of UnidirReconfigSupported, but typical    11                                                                                   applications of unidirectional control will require two Staged Control Sets, for speed purposes.    12

the overall reconfiguration during time-critical link speed negotiations, some module    19                                                                                   form factors may even offer hardware control signals to trigger unidirectional reconfiguration commands,    20                                                                                   instead of writing to the CMIS trigger registers. The management of such ‘rate or speed select Rx/Tx’ functions    21                                                                                   (advertisement, administration, reporting) as well as the encoding and behavior of such control signals is outside    22                                                                                   of the scope of CMIS and is therefore left to form factor specific CMIS adjoint specifications. See section 8.8.    23                                                                                   Unidirectional hot reconfiguration command triggers are effective only in the DPInitialized or in the the    24                                                                                   DPActivated steady states of the relevant DPSM. The module (silently) ignores them in all other states.    25                                                                                   Note: This implies that the original Data Path on first entry to DPInitialized is Rx/Tx symmetrical.    26                                                                                   Unidirectional hot reconfiguration of a Data Path Application is restricted to changing the AppSel code    27                                                                                   consistently on all lanes of the Data Path, and to optionally changing Explicit Control parameters (SI attributes)    28                                                                                   on some or all lanes of the Data Path. The lane allocation to the Data Path must not be modified.    29                                                                                   Unidirectional hot reconfiguration of NP Applications

If host lane <i> feeds the Network Path of an NP Application
instance, the NPIDLane<i> field stores the Network Path ID
of that Network Path, which is defined as the number of the
first host lane feeding the Network Path, decremented by one.
If lane<i> is unused (NPInUseLane<i> = 0), the value of
NPIDLane<i> is ignored.
Note: All lanes of the Network Path of an Application that spans
multiple host lanes have the same NPID.
Note: For example, the NPID of a Network Path carrying the HP
of host lane 1 is 0 and the NPID of a NP where host lane 5 is
the lowest lane number feeding the NP is 4. |  |
|  | 0 | NPInUse | SCS<k>::NPInUseLane<i>
0b: host lane <i> is either part of the Data Path of a DP
Application or it is unused
1b: host lane <i> is part of a Host Path that feeds the Network
Path identified by the NPID field in a NP Application |  |
